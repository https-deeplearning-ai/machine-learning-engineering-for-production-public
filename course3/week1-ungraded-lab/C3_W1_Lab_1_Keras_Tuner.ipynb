You start with an initial design then reconfigure until you get a model that can be trained efficiently in terms of time and compute resources.

These remain constant over the training process and directly impact the performance of your ML program. \n","\n","The process of finding the optimal set of hyperparameters is called *hyperparameter tuning* or *hypertuning*, and it is an essential part of a machine learning pipeline.
