Improving these metrics will help you commit to fairness in your applications. We encourage you to try exploring more slices of the dataset and see what findings you can come up with.\n","\n","For more practice, [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/fairness-indicators/blob/master/g3doc/tutorials/Fairness_Indicators_Example_Colab.ipynb) is an official tutorial that uses fairness indicators on text data. It uses the [What-If-Tool](https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/) which is another package that comes with `Fairness Indicators`. You will also get to explore that in this week's programming assignment."]}]}
