    "## Wrapper Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapper methods use a model to measure the effectiveness of a particular subset of features. As mentioned in class, one approach is to remove or add features sequentially. You can either start with 1 feature and gradually add until no improvement is made (forward selection), or do the reverse (backward selection). That can be done with the [SequentialFeatureSelector](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SequentialFeatureSelector.html#sklearn.feature_selection.SequentialFeatureSelector) class which uses k-fold cross validation scores to decide which features to add or remove. [Recursive Feature Elimination](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFE.html) is similar to backwards elimination but uses feature importance scores to prune the number of features. You can also specify how many features to remove at each iteration of the recursion. Let's use this as the wrapper for our model below."

If you want to save resources, the `F-test` will be the most optimal of these 3 because it uses the least number of features (unless you did the bonus challenge and removed more from `Subset features`). On the other hand, if you find that all the resulting scores for all approaches are acceptable, then you may just go for the method with the smallest set of features."
