    "# Ungraded lab: Serve a model with TensorFlow Serving\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will be taking a look at TFX's model serving system for production called [Tensorflow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving). This system is highly integrated with the Tensorflow stack and provides an easy and straightforward way of deploying models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically you will:\n",
    "- Learn how to install TF serving.\n",
    "- Load a pretrained model that classifies dogs, birds and cats.\n",
    "- Save it following the conventions needed by TF serving.\n",
    "- Spin a web server using TF serving that will accept requests through HTTP.\n",
    "- Interact with your model via a REST API.\n",
    "- Learn about model versioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab draws inspiration from [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tutorials/serving/rest_simple) official Tensorflow tutorial, so check it out if you got doubts about the topics covered here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that unlike last ungraded lab, you will be working with TF serving without using Docker. This is to show you different ways in which this serving system can be used.\n",
