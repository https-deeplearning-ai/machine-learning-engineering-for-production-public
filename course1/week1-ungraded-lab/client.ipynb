    "\n",
    "Let's expand on what you have learned so far. The next logical step is to extend the server and the client so that they can accommodate an additional parameter: the level of confidence of the prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "**To test your extended implementation you must perform the following steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stop the server by interrupting the Kernel.\n",
    "- Extend the `prediction` function in the server.\n",
    "- Re run the cell containing your server code.\n",
    "- Re launch the server.\n",
    "- Extend your client.\n",
    "- Test it with some images (either with your client or fastAPI's one).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some hints that can help you out throughout the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Server side:\n",
    "- The `prediction` function that handles the `/predict` endpoint needs an additional parameter to accept the confidence level. Add this new parameter before the `File` parameter. This is necessary because `File` has a default value and must be specified last.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `cv.detect_common_objects` accepts the `confidence` parameter, which is a floating point number (type `float`in Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Client side:\n",
    "- You can add a new parameter to the URL by extending it with an `&` followed by the name of the parameter and its value. The name of this new parameter must be equal to the name used within the `prediction` function in the server. An example would look like this: `myawesomemodel.com/predict?model=yolov3-tiny&newParam=value` \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sample Solution:\n",
    "- Once you're done with this optional task or if you got stuck while doing it, you can see a sample solution by one of your course mentors [here](https://community.deeplearning.ai/t/c1-w1-optional-challenge-confidence-level/67619). Just make sure you've already joined our Discourse community as shown in an earlier reading item. This is posted in the [MLEP Learner Projects](https://community.deeplearning.ai/c/machine-learning-engineering-for-production/mlep-learner-projects/224) category and feel free to post your own solution (and other content-related projects) there as well. Just remember **not to post any graded material** so as not to violate the Honor Code. You can instead take one of the tools/concepts taught in the lectures or labs then apply it to a mini-project. [Here](https://community.deeplearning.ai/t/fastapi-for-text-classification-problem-in-arabic/56857) is an example. We encourage you to explore your fellow learners' projects and comment on the ones you find interesting.\n",
