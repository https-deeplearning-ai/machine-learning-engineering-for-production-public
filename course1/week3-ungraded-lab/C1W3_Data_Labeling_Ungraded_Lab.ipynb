    "# Week 3 - Ungraded Lab: Data Labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the ungraded lab for week 3 of Machine Learning Engineering for Production. In this lab, you will see how the data labeling process affects the performance of a classification model. Labeling data is usually a very labor intensive and costly task but it is of great importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you saw in the lectures there are many ways to label data, this is dependant on the strategy used. Recall the example with the iguanas, all of the following are valid labeling alternatives but they clearly follow different criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "<table><tr><td><img src='assets/iguanas1.png'></td><td><img src='assets/iguanas2.png'></td><td><img src='assets/iguanas3.png'></td></tr></table>\n",
    "\n",
    "**You can think of every labeling strategy as a result of different labelers following different labeling rules**. If your data is labeled by people using different criteria this will have a negative impact on your learning algorithm. It is desired to have consistent labeling across your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will touch on the effect of labeling strategies from a slighlty different angle. You will explore how different strategies affect the performance of a machine learning model by simulating the process of having different labelers label the data. This, by defining a set of rules and performing automatic labeling based on those rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The main objective of this ungraded lab is to compare performance across labeling options to understand the role that good labeling plays on the performance of Machine Learning models**, these options are:\n",
    "1. Randomly generated labels (performance lower bound)\n",
    "2. Automatic generated labels based on three different label strategies\n",
    "3. True labels (performance upper bound)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the example with the iguanas is a computer vision task, the same concepts regarding labeling can be applied to other types of data. In this lab you will be working with text data, concretely you will be using a dataset containing comments from the 2015 top 5 most popular Youtube videos. Each comment has been labeled as `spam` or `not_spam` depending on its contents."
